    "**Automatic differentiation** (AD) describes a collection of techniques for evaluating the gradient of an expression directly from the expression itself by application of the [chain rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule).  The evaluation of the objective, $f$, as a function of $\\theta$, can be decomposed as $\\theta\\rightarrow\\Lambda\\rightarrow\\Sigma\\rightarrow L\\rightarrow f$.  Application of the *forward rule* involves composing the forward sensitivities, usually written with a dot diacritical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus $\\dot{\\Lambda}=\\frac{d\\Lambda}{d\\theta}$ from which $\\frac{d\\Sigma}{d\\theta}=\\dot{\\Sigma}=\\dot{\\Lambda}^\\prime A \\Lambda+\\Lambda^\\prime A \\dot{\\Lambda}$ can be evaluated. [https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07527] provides methods to evaluate $\\frac{dL}{d\\theta}=\\dot{L}$ from $\\dot{\\Sigma}$ and $L$.  Finally, given $\\dot{L}$ and $L$, the gradient $\\dot{f}=\\frac{d\\,f}{d\\theta}$ can be evaluated.\n",

    "The big advantage of forward-mode AD for this calculation is that the gradient evaluation preserves the sparsity patterns of $\\mathbf{L}$ in $\\dot{\\mathbf{L}}$.  Recall that it is the sparsity of $\\mathbf{L}$ that makes the whole calculation feasible for complex models fit to large data sets.  The disadvantage of forward-mode relative to reverse mode is that the calculations, especially evaluating $\\dot{\\mathbf{L}}$ from $\\dot{\\mathbf{\\Sigma}}$ must be repeated for each element of the gradient vector.  In reverse mode the sensitivities, written $\\bar{\\mathbf{L}}$, etc., are \"pulled back\" from $f$ to $\\mathbf{L}$ to $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}$ to $\\mathbf{\\Lambda}$ and finally to $\\mathbf{\\theta}$.  There is only one calculation at each step until the last.  Unfortunately the sparsity is lost at the first step."
